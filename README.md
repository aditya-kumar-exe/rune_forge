# 💻 Rune Forge

Highly customizable, easy-to-use, and minimal terminal styled website template, powered by Next.js.

Building a simple website with Rune Forge only takes **minutes**, and you only need to work with **one** file: `config.json`. After you cloned this repository, simply run `yarn install && yarn dev` and start editing `config.json` to build your website!

## 📄 Configuration

### Basic Configuration
 
90% of RuneForge's configurations are done through the `config.json` file.

```javascript
{
  "readmeUrl": // create a Github README and link it here!
  "title": // title of the website
  "name": // your name, included in 'about' command
  "ascii": // ascii art to display
  "social": {
    "github": // your handle
    "linkedin": // your handle
  },
  "email": // your email
  "ps1_hostname": "liveterm" // hostname in prompt
  "ps1_username": "visitor", // username in prompt
  "resume_url": "../resume.pdf", // path to your resume
  "non_terminal_url": "W",
  "colors": {
    "light": {
      ...
    },
    "dark": {
      ... // you can use existing templates in themes.json or use your own!
    }
  }
}
```
   
Feel free to change it as you see fit!

### Themes

You can find several pre-configured themes in `themes.json`, and you can replace the colors in `config.json` with the theme color you like!

### Banner

You may also want to change the output of the `banner` command. To do that, simply paste your generated banner in `src/utils/bin/commands.ts`. I used this [website](https://manytools.org/hacker-tools/ascii-banner/) to generate my banner.

### Advanced Configuration

If you want to further customize your page, feel free to change the source code to your liking!

## 🌐 Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy a Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/) from the creators of Next.js.

You can install `vercel` cli and follow the instruction [here](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/overview).

You can also connect your github account to vercel and have vercel automatically deploy the github repository for you.
